[@mrmrs](https://github.com/mrmrs) has a very nice reference site with some useful Vim commands.

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is an interesting tool for studying. It uses flash cards and a fancypants algorithm based on Scienceâ„¢ to determine the best time to show you cards so that you remember the things you're trying to learn.

The text file here can be imported into Anki and it contains almost 200 cards based on the Common Vim link above.
